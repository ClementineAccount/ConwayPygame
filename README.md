# What is this?
This is a simple [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) game made in [Pygame](https://pyga.me/). 

It has been tested only at windowed 800x600 resolution at the moment on Windows. It should still run on Linux or MacOS as it was made with Python without the use of Windows exclusive functions.

This project was not developed with public use in mind, and only targets my own personal computer as a side project.

# Why?
This was a side project as a way to practice Python, Pygame and general coding skills. I made this without following any tutorials, guides or looking at any example code using only the [Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules) section from Wikipedia's page.

# How do I run it?

You'd need both Python and Pygame-ce installed.

Enter the following in the same directory as the script

```
python .\main.py
```
